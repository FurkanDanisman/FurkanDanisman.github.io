Thank you for stopping by.

I’m Furkan, a Research Assistant at the Bank of Canada. My path has been shaped by a commitment to understanding the world through statistics. It’s a discipline that has guided me to research a wide range of fields, from sociology to space engineering, healthcare analytics to sports analytics, and now economics at Canada’s central bank. 

I began my Bachelor of Science in Statistics at the Middle East Technical University and completed it at York University. Throughout my career, I had the privilege of working with remarkable mentors: [Dr. Jankowski](https://www.yorku.ca/hkj/), [Dr. de Souza](https://www.desouzacpe.com/), and [Dr. Kalaylioglu](https://avesis.metu.edu.tr/kzeynep). Their guidance has played a major role in bringing me to where I am today.

Lately, I’ve been drawn to the intersection of large language models (LLMs) and causality, as well as neuroimage analysis. My ultimate goal in life is to understand how the brain works, and how the intentions form. 

If you’re interested in discussing ideas or just sharing perspectives, feel free to reach out.
