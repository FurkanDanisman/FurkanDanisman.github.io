Me: Researcher. I worked on economics, healthcare, space engineering, theoretical statistics, actuarial science, soccer analytics, and more. I enjoyed exploring each of these domain, but fair to say I still know very little about them. 

I am currently doing a PhD at University of Toronto, co-supervised by Dehan Kong (Statistics) and Zhijing Jin (Computer Science). 

Lately, Iâ€™ve been drawn to the intersection of large language models (LLMs) and causality, as well as neuroimage analysis. My ultimate goal in life is to be friends with a gorilla.
