Thank you for paying a visit. 

I am Furkan, a Research Assistant at the Bank of Canada. In this lifetime, I have been fortunate to explore a wide range of fields, all through the lens of a discipline I deeply love, statistics. 

Statistics has allowed me to contribute to research in sociology, space engineering, healthcare analytics, applied and theoretical statistics, sports analytics, and now, economics at Canadaâ€™s central bank. I could not be any more grateful. 

I am also interested in working in the intersection between LLM and causality, and neuroimage analysis. My life goal is to understand how the brain works, and how the intentions form.
