Thank you for stopping by.

I am Furkan, a Research Assistant at the Bank of Canada. In this lifetime, I’ve had the privilege of exploring a wide range of fields, all through the lens of a discipline I deeply love, statistics. 

Statistics has allowed me to research sociology, space engineering, healthcare analytics, applied and theoretical statistics, sports analytics, and now, economics at Canada’s central bank. I couldn’t be more grateful. 

Lately, I’ve been drawn to the intersection of large language models (LLMs) and causality, as well as neuroimage analysis. My ultimate goal in life is to understand how the brain works, and how the intentions form. 

Feel free to reach out if you want to chat!
